## Setting Up A Lambda Function Using Amazon Web Services

In the [first step of this guide](./1-voice-user-interface.md), we built the Voice User Interface (VUI) for our Alexa skill.  On this page, we will be creating an AWS Lambda function using [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com).  You can [read more about what a Lambda function is](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda), but for the purposes of this guide, what you need to know is that AWS Lambda is where our code lives.  When a user asks Alexa to use our skill, it is our AWS Lambda function that interprets the appropriate interaction, and provides the conversation back to the user.

1. **Go to http://aws.amazon.com and sign in to the console.** If you don't already have an account, you will need to create one.  [If you don't have an AWS account, check out this quick walkthrough for setting it up](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/aws/set-up-aws.md).

    [![Developer Console](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/2-1-sign-in-to-the-console._TTH_.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)

2. **Click "Services" at the top of the screen, and type "Lambda" in the search box.**  You can also find Lambda in the list of services.  It is in the "Compute" section.

3. **Check your AWS region.** AWS Lambda only works with the Alexa Skills Kit in these regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo)  and EU (Ireland).  Make sure you choose the region closest to your customers.

4. **Click the orange "Create function" button.** It should be near the top of your screen.  (If you don't see this button, it is because you haven't created a Lambda function before.  Click the blue "Get Started" button near the center of your screen.)

    1.  There are three boxes labeled "Author from scratch", "Blueprints" and "Serverless Application Repository". **Click the radio button in the box titled  "Author from scratch"**  and enter the function name, select **Node.js (>=6.x)** in the **Runtime** field and finally in the **Role** field, **choose an existing role** if you have already created a role before or **create a new role from template(s)** .

5. **Click the Create function button** at the bottom of the page.

6. **Open** the function that was **just created** by clicking on it.

7. (Optional, but recommended) To **secure this Lambda function** follow the instructions found [here](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/aws/secure-lambda-function.md)

8. Scroll down the page until you see a section called **Function code**.

9. Create empty files with the same name as the files in the [lambda](../lambda/) directory. Copy and Paste the code in the files and finally, click "Save" button on the top right corner of the page. If you modify the code, be sure to click "Save".

10. You should see the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) a unique identifier for this function in the top right corner of the page. **Copy the ARN value for this Lambda function** for use in the next section of the guide.
